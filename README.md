## Architecture

The OrgaMinder Frontend was designed following clean code principles and a clear separation of responsibilities, ensuring scalability and maintainability as the project grows. Here is a brief overview of the main project folders and their roles:

The architecture of the Vue application is organized in a modular structure, enhancing maintainability and scalability. Here's a breakdown of the key directories and their roles:

### Main Entry Point
- **`main.js`**: The entry point for the application, where Vue is instantiated and global configurations are applied.

### Root Directory (`src`)
- **`App.vue`**: The main Vue component that serves as the entry point for the application.

### Assets
- **`assets/`**: Contains static assets such as images and logos used throughout the application.

### Components
- **`components/`**: Houses reusable Vue components, organized into subdirectories:
  - **`boards/`**: Contains components related to different board types, such as:
    - **`AccountBoard.vue`**
    - **`CalendarBoard.vue`**
    - **`KanbanBoard.vue`**
  - **`forms/`**: Includes form components, like:
    - **`LoginForm.vue`** and its associated logic file.
  - **`layout/`**: Contains layout components, such as:
    - **`LoggedLayout.vue`** for user-specific layouts.
  - **`modal/`**: Contains modal components for task creation and updates:
    - **`TaskCreateModal.vue`** and **`TaskUpdateModal.vue`**, each with their own logic files.

### Configuration
- **`config/`**: Contains configuration files, such as **`api.js`** for managing API endpoints.

### Firebase
- **`firebase.js`**: Handles Firebase initialization and configuration for authentication and data storage.

### Pages
- **`pages/`**: Contains page components that represent distinct views in the application:
  - **`LoginPage.vue`**: The login view.
  - **`TasksPage.vue`**: The tasks view, along with its logic file.

### Plugins
- **`plugins/`**: Includes configurations for third-party plugins, such as Vuetify for UI components and Webfont Loader for font management.

### Router
- **`router/`**: Contains the routing configuration, specifically **`index.js`**, which defines the application's routes.

### Services
- **`services/`**: Contains service files for handling business logic and API calls, such as **`taskService.js`**.

### Styles
- **`styles/`**: Typically contains global stylesheets or specific styles for the application.

### Utilities
- **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions, such as **`auth.js`** for authentication-related logic.

### Overall Architecture
The architecture promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to manage different aspects of the application. Each directory serves a specific purpose, enabling developers to locate and modify components, services, and configurations efficiently. This modular approach enhances collaboration and reduces complexity as the application grows.
